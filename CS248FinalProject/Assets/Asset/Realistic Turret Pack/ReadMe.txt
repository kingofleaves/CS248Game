Thanks for buying this turrets!

Just drag and drop prefabs from this folder to your scene.

To rotate turret parts select parent nodes of meshes (i.e. laser_base2), not actual mesh (i.e. laser_base2_lod0).

Shader is made with ShaderForge plugin. You can edit it.

Textures are tailored for "gamma" color space.

Contact me if you need help.
